**RAG Implementation with LangChain**

This repository contains a basic implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain. The project utilizes advanced techniques such as the Multi-Query Retriever and Context Compression to enhance the retrieval and generation process. Additionally, the RAG model is evaluated using Answer Relevance techniques to ensure high-quality responses.

**Features**

1: LangChain Integration: Leverages the LangChain framework to streamline the implementation of RAG.
2: Multi-Query Retriever: Improves the retrieval process by generating multiple queries, increasing the chances of fetching relevant documents.
3: Context Compression: Optimizes the input context length to fit within model constraints while preserving essential information.
4: Answer Relevance Evaluation: Uses answer relevance metrics to assess the performance and accuracy of the RAG model.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.8+
Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)
